Give yourself time to think<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Spend some time thinking about who you want to be in 5, 10 or even 20 years. Consider what you love, where you want to live, how much personal time you hope for and what kind of income you\u2019d need to make that lifestyle possible.<\/p>\n<p>COVID has changed the job marketplace so if you can dream it up, your job is probably out there somewhere in an office, work from home or hybrid situation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Personal SWOT your Strengths and Weaknesses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A personal SWOT analysis to understand your strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats you face, so you can plan for career success.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve found some positions of interest, determine if your skill set is a good match.
