The industry is experiencing heightened investment activity now that the negative effects of the 2008 market are dwindling. Companies are innovative, and the FDA has increased the pace of approval for new drugs. Additionally, the Jumpstart Our Businesses Act has encouraged smaller companies to go public.<\/p>\n<p>The first half of 2014 saw IPOs with similar amounts. For example, Cerulean Pharma raised slightly less venture capital than Ardelyx\u2019s $60.8 million at $60.2 million. The second half of 2014 is less certain. Only one of seven biopharmas expected to go public in late June actually did, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, and this company lowered its price from around $12 to $7, implying a possible cooling of biopharma stock.<\/p>\n<p>The top five IPOs for 2014 according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.genengnews.com\/insight-and-intelligence\/top-20-ipos-of-2014-so-far\/77900190\/\">Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News<\/a> include Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Versartis, Kite Pharma, Phibro Animal Health, and Circassia Pharmaceuticals.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical<\/em> netted $126.4 million and went public on January 31, 2014.
