Matt started as an entry-level recruiter and through hard work, lots of caffeine and great guidance from his superiors, he helped establish the Massachusetts division as a top recruiting group in the area and is now leading recruiting efforts for our Mid-Atlantic division supporting the NJ, PA, DE, MD and VA markets. Matt prides himself on finding the best talent possible and matching them with top life science companies throughout the Mid-Atlantic states.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best thing about your job?</strong> I like helping people find their dream jobs, plus I get to work with companies to help grow their organizations and tackle the world’s health and wellness issues from behind the scenes. I may not be curing cancer myself but I’ll find the person that will have a hand in that! It&#8217;s also very rewarding to see the professional and personal growth of my team.</p>
<p><strong>What makes you good at your job?</strong> You can only get so much done in a day and there always seems to be more to do but if you put your head down you can accomplish a lot. I want my team to be successful and we&#8217;ll do our best to get fill the role together as a team.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do for fun?</strong> Traveling to new and exciting places, golfing, heading to the beach and exploring the culinary scene in the Boston area.</p>

With a market full of opportunities, there is no better time to focus on mapping out your dream job and career path.It sounds straightforward but mapping a plan can help narrow your focus and yield unexpected benefits. Try our six career mapping steps to get started along with some tools we like.</p>
<p><strong>1. Give yourself time to think</strong></p>
<p>Spend some time thinking about who you want to be in 5, 10 or even 20 years. Consider what you love, where you want to live, how much personal time you hope for and what kind of income you’d need to make that lifestyle possible.</p>
<p>COVID has changed the job marketplace so if you can dream it up, your job is probably out there somewhere in an office, work from home or hybrid situation.</p>
<p><strong>2. Personal SWOT your Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></p>
<p>A personal SWOT analysis to understand your strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats you face, so you can plan for career success.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found some positions of interest, determine if your skill set is a good match. A great place to start is with a personal SWOT analysis. You can download the Personal SWOT Analysis Worksheet PDF here (<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/worksheets/Personal_SWOT_Analysis_Worksheet.pdf)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">https://www.mindtools.com/worksheets/Personal_SWOT_Analysis_Worksheet.pdf)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified your skills, check compatibility for the path you are researching. Make a plan to reinforce your skills as needed.</p>
<p><strong>3. Mind Map or Vision Board Ideas</strong></p>
<p>If you are like most people, creating a visual of your ideas can really help. Try using a free mind mapping software like EdrawMind (they have a free career mapping template here <a href="https://www.edrawsoft.com/create-careerplanning-mindmap.html)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">https://www.edrawsoft.com/create-careerplanning-mindmap.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss </a>or check out LifeHacker&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://lifehacker.com/build-your-career-master-plan-with-a-mind-map-5991819?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Build Your Career Master Plan with a Mind Map</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you hate working with online tools?  Creating a physical vision board is a great way to remind yourself of what you are aspiring to. Check out People At Heart Coaching&#8217;s <a href="https://www.peopleatheartcoaching.com/create-a-vision-board-in-4-steps?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">tutorial on making a vision board</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Research Positions</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve come up with some ideas, check the market to learn about what positions are in demand, pay rates, time investment, education and market trajectory. You don&#8217;t want to get into a role that will be extinct in 2 years.</p>
<p>A trusted resource is the Occupational Outlook Handbook maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a></p>
<p><strong>5. Network</strong></p>
<p>A wonderful way to learn more about opportunities and the lifestyle of different professions is to reach out to people doing the job today, talk to hiring mangers or specialty recruiters.</p>
<p>Connecting with people to learn more about jobs is one of the best ways to really understand a role with the added benefit that you are build connections and networking with people that can set help you later.</p>
<p>A simple strategy to find people to network with is to scan your LinkedIn accounts for people you know, but don&#8217;t forget to tap your alumni associations, speak to recruiters or ask friends if they can introduce you to people who can help.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><br />
<strong>6. Try, Try, Try It Out</strong></p>
<p>There are several great ways to step in and learn about a job up close.</p>
<p>If you have solid basic skills, you can shadow someone in a job or apply for an internship. Alternatively you can work with a company like <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/contact-life-science-staffing/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">ClinLab Staffing</a> to try different short term contract roles.</p>
<p>No matter what you choose, make the most of the unusual work climate that is unfolding. If you have the skills, the desire and a plan you can make big things happen in 2022 and ClinLab is here to help if you are looking for a new role within the Biotech, Medical Device and Pharmaceutical industries.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT SEAN</strong><br />
I work in Massachusetts on the preclinical side of things, R&amp;D, QA, QC, Manufacturing, and Operations. I have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in communication disorders and worked in the operating room for 4 years. This gave me the opportunity to readjust how I wanted to help give back to the community. I enjoy helping build teams to combat deadly diseases. Now I have been at ClinLab over 4 years building my team.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best thing about your job?</strong> Being able to create lasting relationships with clients as well as seeing recruiters careers blossom within ClinLab.</p>
<p><strong>What makes you good at your job?</strong> My work ethic and determination to succeed along with my team player mentality.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do for fun?</strong> Outside of work I like to ride my motorcycle, golf, snowboard, and hang out with friends.</p>
