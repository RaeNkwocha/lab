With a market full of opportunities, there is no better time to focus on mapping out your dream job and career path.It sounds straightforward but mapping a plan can help narrow your focus and yield unexpected benefits. Try our six career mapping steps to get started along with some tools we like.</p>
<p><strong>1. Give yourself time to think</strong></p>
<p>Spend some time thinking about who you want to be in 5, 10 or even 20 years. Consider what you love, where you want to live, how much personal time you hope for and what kind of income you’d need to make that lifestyle possible.</p>
<p>COVID has changed the job marketplace so if you can dream it up, your job is probably out there somewhere in an office, work from home or hybrid situation.</p>
<p><strong>2. Personal SWOT your Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></p>
<p>A personal SWOT analysis to understand your strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats you face, so you can plan for career success.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found some positions of interest, determine if your skill set is a good match. A great place to start is with a personal SWOT analysis. You can download the Personal SWOT Analysis Worksheet PDF here (<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/worksheets/Personal_SWOT_Analysis_Worksheet.pdf)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">https://www.mindtools.com/worksheets/Personal_SWOT_Analysis_Worksheet.pdf)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified your skills, check compatibility for the path you are researching. Make a plan to reinforce your skills as needed.</p>
<p><strong>3. Mind Map or Vision Board Ideas</strong></p>
<p>If you are like most people, creating a visual of your ideas can really help. Try using a free mind mapping software like EdrawMind (they have a free career mapping template here <a href="https://www.edrawsoft.com/create-careerplanning-mindmap.html)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">https://www.edrawsoft.com/create-careerplanning-mindmap.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss </a>or check out LifeHacker&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://lifehacker.com/build-your-career-master-plan-with-a-mind-map-5991819?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Build Your Career Master Plan with a Mind Map</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you hate working with online tools?  Creating a physical vision board is a great way to remind yourself of what you are aspiring to. Check out People At Heart Coaching&#8217;s <a href="https://www.peopleatheartcoaching.com/create-a-vision-board-in-4-steps?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">tutorial on making a vision board</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Research Positions</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve come up with some ideas, check the market to learn about what positions are in demand, pay rates, time investment, education and market trajectory. You don&#8217;t want to get into a role that will be extinct in 2 years.</p>
<p>A trusted resource is the Occupational Outlook Handbook maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a></p>
<p><strong>5. Network</strong></p>
<p>A wonderful way to learn more about opportunities and the lifestyle of different professions is to reach out to people doing the job today, talk to hiring mangers or specialty recruiters.</p>
<p>Connecting with people to learn more about jobs is one of the best ways to really understand a role with the added benefit that you are build connections and networking with people that can set help you later.</p>
<p>A simple strategy to find people to network with is to scan your LinkedIn accounts for people you know, but don&#8217;t forget to tap your alumni associations, speak to recruiters or ask friends if they can introduce you to people who can help.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><br />
<strong>6. Try, Try, Try It Out</strong></p>
<p>There are several great ways to step in and learn about a job up close.</p>
<p>If you have solid basic skills, you can shadow someone in a job or apply for an internship. Alternatively you can work with a company like <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/contact-life-science-staffing/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">ClinLab Staffing</a> to try different short term contract roles.</p>
<p>No matter what you choose, make the most of the unusual work climate that is unfolding. If you have the skills, the desire and a plan you can make big things happen in 2022 and ClinLab is here to help if you are looking for a new role within the Biotech, Medical Device and Pharmaceutical industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of 2019, we surveyed a group of Life Science Professionals and found that 40% of respondents said they’d be looking for a new job that year. Once COVID-19 hit, the world (and people’s willingness to take a gamble) took a sharp 180. The country went remote, nothing was guaranteed, and Biotech and Life Science companies expanded faster than ever as they raced to fill spots on their teams in order to balance their current workloads along with the testing and research needs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, we surveyed another group of Life Science Professionals and found that only 25% of respondents said they’d be looking for a new job in 2021, and there could be multiple reasons why.</p>
<p>Firstly, instability naturally encourages people to search for, and hold onto, stability. In a time of great uncertainty, with groups of people involuntarily getting furloughed or being laid off, people in the life sciences industry were given a multitude of options in the workplace as companies were hiring as many hands as they could.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current market compensation is healthy with most companies being on the same playing field in the hopes of reducing turnover. With the industry leveling out and companies working hard to keep their staff happy while producing quality work, there isn’t much grass that looks greener on the other side. Companies worked so hard to fill the gaps left by the quick pivot to COVID-19 vaccine research and development that they’d be remiss to not do everything in their power to prevent that from happening again.</p>
<p>Finally, most people may simply be waiting to see how 2021 turns out. This year is young and there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>If, however, you have decided to make the jump into a new job this year, you’ll have options and we have tips for you.</p>
<p>Many biotech and life science companies have continued to hire throughout the start of the new year and plan on continuing to do so. COVID-19 vaccine (and the research, development, and innovation that came with it) aside, the life sciences industry continued to grow throughout the pandemic and where there’s growth, there are jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Now, for the tips!</strong></p>
<p>Tip #1 &#8211; Be sure to do your research into the policies of any potential employers before you start the interview process. With the advancement of work from home capabilities, many companies have created their own systems in regards to in-person and virtual office time.</p>
<p>Tip #2 &#8211;  Be flexible! Ask the questions you need, but consider all of the options you’re given as your timing could be perfect when you least expect it!</p>
<p>Tip #3 &#8211; Research your company in advance but also check the news the day before and day of your interview &#8211; things change fast! Today&#8217;s darling drug trial can be tomorrow&#8217;s hot mess &#8211; but it may be a mess you know how to solve!</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 was an odd year and 2021 shaping up to be much the same for the Biotech and Pharma industries.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebooth/2021/01/04/the-biotech-paradox-of-2020-a-year-in-review/?sh=675ac5b943b3&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Forbes Magazine</a>, 2020 was “the greatest year ever for the biopharma industry” and it was true -it’s still true. Along with the wild ride that was 2020, we’ve seen a light shined on the critical role our human capital has in the success, performance and growth of life science companies.</p>

Labs were inundated with human testing needs, clinical trials launched at an astronomical rate, massive testing programs struggled to meet public health and consumer needs all while new rapid diagnostic tests were being rolled out across the globe. Our science community was pushed like never before, and they delivered.</p>
<p>Now, in 2021 and 2022, procuring the right talent to meet the ever-changing workforce needs that continue to get more complex and challenging will be critical to company stability, growth and ultimately longevity.</p>
<p>In Q4 of 2020, ClinLab surveyed Life Science professionals about how they felt about the 2020 and 2021 life science employment landscape in our 2020 Life Science Annual Job Seeker and Employer Survey. We found that 49% of respondents browsed jobs in 2020 with  38% of those surveyed planning to actively seek or browse for new opportunities in 2021.</p>
<p>Did you know that when an employee leaves, companies lose productivity and money at an alarming rate.</p>

<li>An empty position can cost a company upwards of $500 per day</li>
<li>Stalled projects, regulatory gaps and deadline impacts can be costly</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Life Science/Biotechnology/Pharmaceutical Staffing: </b><b>Pivot and Ramp Up</b></p>
<p>In the cases of rapid ramp-up, companies can also face serious challenges in other areas they may not currently be serving.  In 2020 we saw a slew of companies pivot to the rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19 and with that came an unprecedented increase in life science jobs as companies tried to pad their staff with enough bandwidth to complete their day to day operations as well as serve the current climate.</p>
<p>We saw increases across the board but particularly heavily in titles such as lab tech, quality control, process development, accessioning technicians and clinical research associates. So how do companies handle massive, rapid changes in staffing needs so quickly and effectively? With Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions, of course!</p>
<p><b>Temporary Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions</b></p>
<p>While employers should always focus on expanding their recruitment channels as a way to prepare for staffing changes and employee turnover, most organizations will look to staffing and recruiting companies as the top method for recruiting quality talent. According to Hubspot, when companies were asked to identify their most effective recruiting method, staffing and recruitment companies ranked the highest.</p>
<p>So while the market still looks bullish for job seekers, the prospect of big job turnover looms large as a major challenge for businesses and we can help. A firm like ClinLab Staffing has a robust, vetted stable of <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-sciences-recruitment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">qualified temporary contract lab and life science staff</a>, we make life easier and get a company on mission fast in times of transition.  ClinLab also offers <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-science-staffing-payroll-solutions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">payroll solutions</a> to allow companies to add staff as needed without adding to payroll or overall permanent headcount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regions we serve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boston/Cambridge, MA</li>
<li>New York / New Jersey</li>
<li>Greater Philadelphia</li>
<li>Raleigh-Durham, NC (includes Research Triangle Park, NC)</li>
<li>BioHealth Capital Region [Maryland / Virginia / Washington, D.C.]</li>

Every time you open the news, different biotech companies are making headlines, and oftentimes, they have a tie to Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We wanted to do a roundup of some of the names we&#8217;ve seen most this year, so we sent one of our writers out to collect a list of the top Massachusetts biotechs based on the most common search queries 2020 has seen so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We found that three companies rounded out the top of the heap:</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2213_RC01/embed_loader.js?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"moderna","geo":"US","time":"2020-01-01 2020-12-31"},{"keyword":"Pfizer","geo":"US","time":"2020-01-01 2020-12-31"},{"keyword":"AstraZeneca","geo":"US","time":"2020-01-01 2020-12-31"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=2020-01-01%202020-12-31&geo=US&q=moderna,Pfizer,AstraZeneca","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"}); </script></p>
<h2>Moderna</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.modernatx.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">www.modernatx.com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a></p>
<p>Founded in 2010, Moderna’s mission is to “deliver on the promise of mRNA science to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients.” The company’s work is founded on the usage of mRNA (Messenger RNA) medicines. This is considered a new approach to treating disease which uses the natural biology of the body. Moderna is headquartered in Cambridge, MA and researches a variety of areas, including infectious, rare, and autoimmune diseases. They are partnered with AstraZeneca, #2 on this list, to work on immuno-oncology, cardiometabolic disease and cancer, and other treatment candidates. Since January 2020, Moderna has worked to develop their candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine, named mRNA-1273. They are now undergoing Phase 3 of their clinical trials, working closely with the NIH and BARDA.</p>
<h2>AstraZeneca</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.astrazeneca.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">www.astrazeneca.com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a></p>
<p>A British-Swedish company, AstraZeneca opened its first U.S. offices in 1953 as one of the first pharmaceutical companies in the country. AstraZeneca is a global company that is driven by science to improve quality of life. The company’s main areas of focus are in oncology; cardiovascular, renal and metabolism; and respiratory diseases. AstraZeneca prides themselves on their entrepreneurial spirit, sustainable culture, and transformative science. With their stated priorities of accelerating innovative science, driving growth in leadership, and being a great place to work, they strive to put their patients first and use science-based research. AstraZeneca, in collaboration with the University of Oxford, is working on developing a vaccine for COVID-19, but their clinical trials are on pause to review the safety of their vaccine candidate.</p>
<h2>Pfizer</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.pfizer.com/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">www.pfizer.com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a></p>
<p>Founded in 1849, Pfizer’s mission is “to be the premier, innovative biopharmaceutical company.” They approach this mission by advancing the development of healthcare products, collaborating with healthcare providers, and advancing global knowledge of disease. Pfizer is the most profitable pharmaceutical company in the world with a revenue of $51.75 billion in 2019. They are currently partnering with BioNTech to co-develop a potential vaccine for COVID-19. The company aims to make healthcare affordable and accessible to all, working with local governments and communities as well as global partners. Pfizer has shown a large spike in interest in July 2020, which was likely a result of their development of a potential COVID-19 vaccine and the U.S. government’s initial purchase of 100 million doses of this vaccine. Headquartered in New York, NY, the company has offices throughout the country including multiple in Massachusetts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the COVID-19 Pandemic has changed office life, companies are making significant adjustments to daily operations to accommodate social distancing, which includes how they conduct the interview process. With all of the video conferencing software available virtual interviews, as opposed to meeting face to face have become essential and much more common than ever before.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3562" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="how to do virtual interviews job" width="1800" height="1200" srcset="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1800w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-1280x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-980x653.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 980w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-480x320.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Preparing for a virtual interview can be nerve-wracking, so we’ve put together the following tips to help set you up for success.</p>
<p><b>Dress for Success </b></p>
<p>Even if you’re only visible from the waist up, prepare for this interview as if you were going into an office for a face to face meeting. Putting your best professional foot forward is important, even virtually. Making sure you project that professionalism is tough through a screen, so your attire is a good place to start and yes, that includes pants.</p>
<p><b>Test your Tech </b></p>
<p>Technology is key in times like these. Not only are you being interviewed on your skills in relation to the job you’ve applied for, but in a way, you’re also being tested on your technological skills and ability to be proactive and problem solve. Ask for the technology and details for the virtual interview in advance, and then test your set up to make sure everything runs smoothly. Does your camera work? Is your audio clear? How strong is your internet connection? These are all things that can be done before the interview to alleviate stress day of and avoid the embarrassment of a technological problem during the interview.</p>
<p><b>Be Aware of What’s Visible in the Background </b></p>
<p>As tempting as it may be to sit on the couch and be comfortable or show off your gallery wall you’ve worked so hard on, don’t. Set your computer up, turn on your camera, and take a look at what’s visible behind you. What setting in your space looks most professional and also the least distracting? Make sure your space is clean and tidy, messy backgrounds make it hard to convince a potential employer that you’re organized and detail oriented, and also make sure you’re the focal point. Lighting is key, so if possible, pick a space with a lot of natural light.</p>
<p><b>Remove Distractions</b></p>
<p>This one may be tough, but it’s doable. Interviewing from home means there are distractions galore. The TV, ringing phones,  your pets, your roommates or children, construction happening outside, the list goes on and on. Do what you can to eliminate the easiest distractions, and prepare for the possibility that you’re still interrupted. You can’t plan for every potential distraction, but even a little preparation helps. If you have kids or are caring for an elderly family member, feel free to be proactive and let your potential employers know at the start of the interview.</p>
<p><b>Practice</b></p>
<p>The best part of a virtual interview is the ability to do it within the comfort of your own space. This gives you the opportunity to practice in the same environment as the interview. Go over the questions you may have, the answers to questions they may ask, your body language, and anything else you don’t want to forget or feel you’d like to practice. Avoid memorizing answers, you don’t want to sound scripted, but use Post-It Notes to write down reminders and talking points, and stick them to the computer screen or the wall within your line of sight so you don’t have to fidget or look down at a piece of paper during the interview. Adjust the camera angle to make sure you’re looking straight on, not up or down, and that it’s comfortable so that you can sit straight up.</p>
<p><b>Follow Up </b></p>
<p>Just as you treated the process before the virtual interview the same as you would if it were in person, do the same for post interview. This includes following up with the people you interviewed within 24 hours of the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip: When <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-sciences-candidates/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">working with a recruiter</a>, be sure to ask them how best to follow up with a company &#8211; this will save you time and effort up front!</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That said, do send an email thanking them for taking the time to speak with you, and use this as an opportunity to ask a question you thought of after and wish you had asked, or elaborating on a point you felt was important. Keep your message tone professional and messages should short and to the point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most of America is locked down at home, in almost every case, pharmaceutical, medical device and equipment, and biotechnology companies (including operations, research and development, manufacture, and supply chain) organizations are considered essential workers and are facing this global challenge head on.</p>
<p>Even with diminished staff and resources, the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry continues to work toward the development of diagnostics, vaccines and therapies for respiratory infection.</p>
<p>The FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration) has taken action to streamline discovery, while many diagnostic tools and drug targets are starting to find their way into the greater conversation about how to handle SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease itself.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#coronavirus2019?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Authorization of Emergency Use</a>: On the basis of this determination, the FDA Secretary declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of personal respiratory protective devices during the COVID-19 outbreak.</li>
</ul>
<p>While regulatory issues are being managed, some companies are starting to make progress on diagnostic tools. Testing has been a significant challenge for the US and is essential for identifying people who have been infected and for understanding the true scope of the outbreak. A few companies are making strides in this space.</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbott: The FDA <a href="https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-03-18-Abbott-Receives-FDA-Emergency-Use-Authorization-and-Launches-Test-to-Detect-Novel-Coronavirus?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">approved</a> <a href="https://www.biospace.com/employer/545692/abbott-laboratories/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Abbott</a>’s molecular test for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The company indicates it is immediately shipping 150,000 Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA tests to current customers in the U.S.</li>
<li>Biomerica has begun shipping samples of this COVID-19 test to multiple Ministries of Health and government agencies that have requested the product through the company’s distributors in the Middle East, throughout Europe, and other countries</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, what will help get the global population back to life as we knew it will be healing and preventive measures. Here, companies are attempting to find therapies to treat the illness and eventually prevent infection.</p>
<h2><b>Failed clinical studies</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>In adults with severe COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan, China, treatment using a combination of antiviral drugs – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopinavir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">lopinavir</a>–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">ritonavir</a> (HIV/AIDS therapies) – provided no benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Vaccine candidates</b></h2>
<p>Two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Phase I safety clinical trials</a> on vaccine candidates were initiated:</p>
<ul>
<li>mRNA-1273: The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) collaborated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Moderna</a> to develop an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">RNA vaccine</a> matching a spike of the coronavirus surface.</li>
<li>Ad5-nCoV: A Phase I safety trial of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_protein?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">recombinant</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenovirus?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">adenovirus</a> vaccine candidate manufactured by CanSino Biologics Inc. (Tianjin, China), called Ad5-nCoV, began recruiting 108 healthy adults in Wuhan, China in March.</li>
<li>Several other vaccine candidates were being fast-tracked to begin first-in-human studies, as of March 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Post-exposure prevention</b></h2>
<p>Based on experience with antimicrobials, pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs may be effective procedures to minimize infection which causes COVID-19.  PEP using the antibiotic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">rifampicin</a>, is recommended by WHO for people at high risk of infection before or after exposure to pandemic influenza. Some experts speculate that antiviral drugs administered shortly after the onset of COVID-19 infection symptoms may reduce illness and lower the risk of infecting other people by reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">viral shedding</a> in respiratory secretions.</p>
<h2><b>Repurposing approved drugs</b></h2>
<p>During the COVID-19 outbreak, drug repurposing (or “repositioning”) is the clinical research process of rapidly screening and defining the safety and efficacy of existing drugs already approved for other diseases to be used for people with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Clinical trials using repurposed, generally safe, existing drugs for hospitalized COVID-19 patients may take less time and have lower overall costs to obtain endpoints proving safety (absence of serious side effects) and post-infection efficacy, and can rapidly access existing drug supply chains for manufacturing and worldwide distribution.</p>
<h2><b>Phase III trials</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Favipiravir: In people with COVID-19, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favipiravir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">favipiravir</a> (marketed as Avigan and approved for use in Japan in 2014 for several viral diseases) was found to be safe and had preliminary efficacy in an early-stage trial in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Shenzhen</a>, China.</li>
<li>Remdesivir: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilead_Sciences?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gilead Sciences</a> antivirus drug candidate is in multiple clinical trials, with preliminary results expected in May 2020</li>
<li>ASC-09 + ritonavir (oral tablet): ASC-09 (product of the Chinese firm, Ascletis Pharma Inc.), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-1?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">HIV-1</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">protease inhibitor</a> in combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">ritonavir</a>, was initiated in a Phase III trial in China during February 2020 to assess efficacy against COVID-19.</li>
<li>Tocilizumab: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">monoclonal antibody</a> with activity against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin-6_receptor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">interleukin-6 receptor</a> involved in inflammation, tocilizumab is already marketed under the trade name, Actemra, to treat arthritis. It is under clinical development to determine safety and efficacy against pneumonia in hospitalized people with COVID-19. The manufacturer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Genentech</a>, announced the April start of a Phase III trial across several countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>There is no need to reiterate that these are unprecedented times. Recently released <a href="https://youtu.be/kF_TZjECSLg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">drone footage video of Boston </a>tells a clear story about how seriously many communities are taking the COVID-19 Stay-At-Home declarations across America. In these times, ClinLab wishes the labs and companies working on the COVID-19 challenge the best of luck and applauds and supports their efforts.</strong></em></p>
