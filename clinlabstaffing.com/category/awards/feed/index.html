										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Boston, MA (May 19, 2021) — The Boston Business Journal has named ClinLab Staffing to its exclusive 2021 Fast 50 list, which represent the 50 fastest-growing private companies in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The Fast 50 companies are selected and ranked based on a formula that counts revenue growth from 2017 to 2020.</p>
<p>The numbers were crunched and analyzed by the Business Journal’s research department.</p>
<p>“The economic shutdown sent a lot of companies&#8217; strategies and financials into uncharted territory in 2020, but as the Fast 50 illustrates, Greater Boston&#8217;s fastest-growth companies pivoted and prospered despite it all,” Carolyn M. Jones, market president and publisher of the Boston Business Journal.</p>
<p>A Fast 50 special publication is scheduled to run in the May 21 weekly edition of the Business Journal and online that week as well. A private virtual honoree celebration to honor this year&#8217;s Fast 50 is scheduled to be held on <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/event/166522/2021/2021-fast-50-virtual-honoree-celebration?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Wednesday, May 19</a>, where the rankings will be released.</p>
<p>Companies on the Fast 50 must have their headquarters in Massachusetts and must have reported revenue of at least $500,000 in 2017 and $1 million in 2020 were considered. (Unlike in past years, due to the pandemic, companies were not disqualified from the ranking if they experienced a net loss during one of the years analyzed, provided growth from 2017 to 2020 was positive.)</p>
<p>For the complete list of 2021 Fast 50 companies, visit <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2021/03/25/fast-50-2021-fastest-growing-private-ma-companies.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">the BBJ’s website here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/about-us?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Boston Business Journal</a> is the region&#8217;s premier business media organization, one of 43 markets owned by American City Business Journals.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>For the 3RD Consecutive Year, CLINLAB STAFFING Appears on the Inc. 5000,<br />
</strong><strong>Ranking No. 3704 With Three-Year Revenue Growth of 98 Percent!</strong></p>
<p><strong>NEW YORK, August 12, 2020</strong> – <em>Inc.</em> magazine today revealed that CLINLAB STAFFING is No. 3704 on its annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.</p>
<p>Not only have the companies on the 2020 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but the list as a whole shows staggering growth compared with prior lists as well. The 2020 Inc. 5000 achieved an incredible three-year average growth of over 500 percent, and a median rate of 165 percent. The Inc. 5000’s aggregate revenue was $209 billion in 2019, accounting for over 1 million jobs over the past three years.</p>
<p>Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at <a href="http://www.inc.com/inc5000?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">www.inc.com/inc5000?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss</a>. The top 500 companies are also being featured in the September issue of <em>Inc.</em>, available on newsstands August 18.</p>
<p>“The companies on this year’s Inc. 5000 come from nearly every realm of business,” says <em>Inc.</em> editor-in-chief Scott Omelianuk. “From health and software to media and hospitality, the 2020 list proves that no matter the sector, incredible growth is based on the foundations of tenacity and opportunism.”</p>
<p>The annual Inc. 5000 event honoring the companies on the list will be held virtually from October 23 to 27, 2020. As always, speakers will include some of the greatest innovators and business leaders of our generation.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>More about <em>Inc.</em> and the Inc. 5000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p>The 2020 Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth when comparing 2016 and 2019. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2016. They had to be U.S.-based, privately held, for profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2019. (Since then, a number of companies on the list have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2016 is $100,000; the minimum for 2019 is $2 million. As always, <em>Inc.</em> reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Companies on the Inc. 500 are featured in <em>Inc.</em>’s September issue.
