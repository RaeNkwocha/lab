										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of 2019, we surveyed a group of Life Science Professionals and found that 40% of respondents said they’d be looking for a new job that year. Once COVID-19 hit, the world (and people’s willingness to take a gamble) took a sharp 180. The country went remote, nothing was guaranteed, and Biotech and Life Science companies expanded faster than ever as they raced to fill spots on their teams in order to balance their current workloads along with the testing and research needs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, we surveyed another group of Life Science Professionals and found that only 25% of respondents said they’d be looking for a new job in 2021, and there could be multiple reasons why.</p>
<p>Firstly, instability naturally encourages people to search for, and hold onto, stability. In a time of great uncertainty, with groups of people involuntarily getting furloughed or being laid off, people in the life sciences industry were given a multitude of options in the workplace as companies were hiring as many hands as they could.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current market compensation is healthy with most companies being on the same playing field in the hopes of reducing turnover. With the industry leveling out and companies working hard to keep their staff happy while producing quality work, there isn’t much grass that looks greener on the other side. Companies worked so hard to fill the gaps left by the quick pivot to COVID-19 vaccine research and development that they’d be remiss to not do everything in their power to prevent that from happening again.</p>
<p>Finally, most people may simply be waiting to see how 2021 turns out. This year is young and there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>If, however, you have decided to make the jump into a new job this year, you’ll have options and we have tips for you.</p>
<p>Many biotech and life science companies have continued to hire throughout the start of the new year and plan on continuing to do so. COVID-19 vaccine (and the research, development, and innovation that came with it) aside, the life sciences industry continued to grow throughout the pandemic and where there’s growth, there are jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Now, for the tips!</strong></p>
<p>Tip #1 &#8211; Be sure to do your research into the policies of any potential employers before you start the interview process. With the advancement of work from home capabilities, many companies have created their own systems in regards to in-person and virtual office time.</p>
<p>Tip #2 &#8211;  Be flexible! Ask the questions you need, but consider all of the options you’re given as your timing could be perfect when you least expect it!</p>
<p>Tip #3 &#8211; Research your company in advance but also check the news the day before and day of your interview &#8211; things change fast! Today&#8217;s darling drug trial can be tomorrow&#8217;s hot mess &#8211; but it may be a mess you know how to solve!</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As U.S. businesses brace and prepare for the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, ClinLab Staffing is working with biotech and pharma companies to create backup plans and strategize for emergency biotech labor in anticipation of work product shortages due to interruptions in foreign CRO, lab and technical availability.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2748 alignleft" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/scientific-biotech-staffing-coronavirus-2020-US.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="coronavirus impact on US scientific staff" width="275" height="183" />The impact of COVID-19 is beginning to extend into the American Biotech space as the outbreak expands into the new regions. Executives say they face both increases in their labor requirements and service shortages in general but as reliance on Chinese contract research organizations strategies falter, companies face real capacity challenges to meet deadlines and goals.</p>
<p>C&amp;EN<a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/Biotech-firms-consider-contingency-as-the-coronavirus-outbreak-hits-CROs/98/i7?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss"> recently reported</a> on challenges faced by Massachusetts biotech startups who rely on Chinese contract research organizations (CROs) &#8212; the virus impact in China is forcing these companies to build in backup strategies and employ alternate service providers as well as engaging companies like ClinLab staffing to bring temporary contract CRO services in-house.</p>
<p>While the exact consequences of COVID-19 are difficult to predict, recent disruptions in the supply chain, as well as fragility in the financial markets, are causing many organizations to plan for labor supply issues due to quarantine procedures or illness. On top of supply chain concern, the possibility of travel restrictions to certain areas may cause businesses to seek alternative sources of supply.</p>
<p>If your biotech, lab, or drug development and discovery organization is facing staffing challenges, please contact us at ClinLab Staffing <a href="tel:508.907.6222">508.907.6222</a> to work with one of our knowledgeable specialists to help keep your company on time, on target, and ready to handle the potential staffing and work product shortages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Our ClinLab Staffing Division works with a CRO client whose internal headcount continuously fluctuates based on the project work that needs to be completed for their customers.  Their typical project will start with a few days’ notice, will last for 3-6 months and will require them to hire contract employees to fill the technical gaps required by each specific customers’ needs.  ClinLab has partnered with them to augment their staff with anywhere from 3-6 specialized contract employees who fit the required, specialized skills and were available to start with days’ notice on several occasions.   Our services enabled our client to complete their project on time and under budget in spite of tight deadlines.</p>
