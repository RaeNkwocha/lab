										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of 2019, we surveyed a group of Life Science Professionals and found that 40% of respondents said they’d be looking for a new job that year. Once COVID-19 hit, the world (and people’s willingness to take a gamble) took a sharp 180. The country went remote, nothing was guaranteed, and Biotech and Life Science companies expanded faster than ever as they raced to fill spots on their teams in order to balance their current workloads along with the testing and research needs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, we surveyed another group of Life Science Professionals and found that only 25% of respondents said they’d be looking for a new job in 2021, and there could be multiple reasons why.</p>
<p>Firstly, instability naturally encourages people to search for, and hold onto, stability. In a time of great uncertainty, with groups of people involuntarily getting furloughed or being laid off, people in the life sciences industry were given a multitude of options in the workplace as companies were hiring as many hands as they could.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current market compensation is healthy with most companies being on the same playing field in the hopes of reducing turnover. With the industry leveling out and companies working hard to keep their staff happy while producing quality work, there isn’t much grass that looks greener on the other side. Companies worked so hard to fill the gaps left by the quick pivot to COVID-19 vaccine research and development that they’d be remiss to not do everything in their power to prevent that from happening again.</p>
<p>Finally, most people may simply be waiting to see how 2021 turns out. This year is young and there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>If, however, you have decided to make the jump into a new job this year, you’ll have options and we have tips for you.</p>
<p>Many biotech and life science companies have continued to hire throughout the start of the new year and plan on continuing to do so. COVID-19 vaccine (and the research, development, and innovation that came with it) aside, the life sciences industry continued to grow throughout the pandemic and where there’s growth, there are jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Now, for the tips!</strong></p>
<p>Tip #1 &#8211; Be sure to do your research into the policies of any potential employers before you start the interview process. With the advancement of work from home capabilities, many companies have created their own systems in regards to in-person and virtual office time.</p>
<p>Tip #2 &#8211;  Be flexible! Ask the questions you need, but consider all of the options you’re given as your timing could be perfect when you least expect it!</p>
<p>Tip #3 &#8211; Research your company in advance but also check the news the day before and day of your interview &#8211; things change fast! Today&#8217;s darling drug trial can be tomorrow&#8217;s hot mess &#8211; but it may be a mess you know how to solve!</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 was an odd year and 2021 shaping up to be much the same for the Biotech and Pharma industries.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebooth/2021/01/04/the-biotech-paradox-of-2020-a-year-in-review/?sh=675ac5b943b3&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Forbes Magazine</a>, 2020 was “the greatest year ever for the biopharma industry” and it was true -it’s still true. Along with the wild ride that was 2020, we’ve seen a light shined on the critical role our human capital has in the success, performance and growth of life science companies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3681" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="rapid employee staff changes science" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1920w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-1280x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-980x653.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 980w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-480x320.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1920px, 100vw" />In a year where labs rapidly ramped up to meet the challenges of COVID-19, businesses and municipalities doubled, tripled and even quadrupled their lab techs and data analysts as they scrambled to find new ways to measure and understand the world. Labs were inundated with human testing needs, clinical trials launched at an astronomical rate, massive testing programs struggled to meet public health and consumer needs all while new rapid diagnostic tests were being rolled out across the globe. Our science community was pushed like never before, and they delivered.</p>
<p>Now, in 2021 and 2022, procuring the right talent to meet the ever-changing workforce needs that continue to get more complex and challenging will be critical to company stability, growth and ultimately longevity.</p>
<p>In Q4 of 2020, ClinLab surveyed Life Science professionals about how they felt about the 2020 and 2021 life science employment landscape in our 2020 Life Science Annual Job Seeker and Employer Survey. We found that 49% of respondents browsed jobs in 2020 with  38% of those surveyed planning to actively seek or browse for new opportunities in 2021.</p>
<p>Did you know that when an employee leaves, companies lose productivity and money at an alarming rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>It typically takes an average 3.5 months to replace non-executive positions</li>
<li>An empty position can cost a company upwards of $500 per day</li>
<li>Stalled projects, regulatory gaps and deadline impacts can be costly</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Life Science/Biotechnology/Pharmaceutical Staffing: </b><b>Pivot and Ramp Up</b></p>
<p>In the cases of rapid ramp-up, companies can also face serious challenges in other areas they may not currently be serving.  In 2020 we saw a slew of companies pivot to the rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19 and with that came an unprecedented increase in life science jobs as companies tried to pad their staff with enough bandwidth to complete their day to day operations as well as serve the current climate.</p>
<p>We saw increases across the board but particularly heavily in titles such as lab tech, quality control, process development, accessioning technicians and clinical research associates. So how do companies handle massive, rapid changes in staffing needs so quickly and effectively? With Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions, of course!</p>
<p><b>Temporary Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions</b></p>
<p>While employers should always focus on expanding their recruitment channels as a way to prepare for staffing changes and employee turnover, most organizations will look to staffing and recruiting companies as the top method for recruiting quality talent. According to Hubspot, when companies were asked to identify their most effective recruiting method, staffing and recruitment companies ranked the highest.</p>
<p>So while the market still looks bullish for job seekers, the prospect of big job turnover looms large as a major challenge for businesses and we can help. A firm like ClinLab Staffing has a robust, vetted stable of <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-sciences-recruitment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">qualified temporary contract lab and life science staff</a>, we make life easier and get a company on mission fast in times of transition.  ClinLab also offers <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-science-staffing-payroll-solutions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">payroll solutions</a> to allow companies to add staff as needed without adding to payroll or overall permanent headcount.</p>
