Matt started as an entry-level recruiter and through hard work, lots of caffeine and great guidance from his superiors, he helped establish the Massachusetts division as a top recruiting group in the area and is now leading recruiting efforts for our Mid-Atlantic division supporting the NJ, PA, DE, MD and VA markets. Matt prides himself on finding the best talent possible and matching them with top life science companies throughout the Mid-Atlantic states.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best thing about your job?</strong> I like helping people find their dream jobs, plus I get to work with companies to help grow their organizations and tackle the world’s health and wellness issues from behind the scenes. I may not be curing cancer myself but I’ll find the person that will have a hand in that! It&#8217;s also very rewarding to see the professional and personal growth of my team.</p>
<p><strong>What makes you good at your job?</strong> You can only get so much done in a day and there always seems to be more to do but if you put your head down you can accomplish a lot. I want my team to be successful and we&#8217;ll do our best to get fill the role together as a team.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do for fun?</strong> Traveling to new and exciting places, golfing, heading to the beach and exploring the culinary scene in the Boston area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 was an odd year and 2021 shaping up to be much the same for the Biotech and Pharma industries.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebooth/2021/01/04/the-biotech-paradox-of-2020-a-year-in-review/?sh=675ac5b943b3&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Forbes Magazine</a>, 2020 was “the greatest year ever for the biopharma industry” and it was true -it’s still true. Along with the wild ride that was 2020, we’ve seen a light shined on the critical role our human capital has in the success, performance and growth of life science companies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3681" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="rapid employee staff changes science" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1920w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-1280x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-980x653.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 980w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-480x320.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1920px, 100vw" />In a year where labs rapidly ramped up to meet the challenges of COVID-19, businesses and municipalities doubled, tripled and even quadrupled their lab techs and data analysts as they scrambled to find new ways to measure and understand the world. Labs were inundated with human testing needs, clinical trials launched at an astronomical rate, massive testing programs struggled to meet public health and consumer needs all while new rapid diagnostic tests were being rolled out across the globe. Our science community was pushed like never before, and they delivered.</p>
<p>Now, in 2021 and 2022, procuring the right talent to meet the ever-changing workforce needs that continue to get more complex and challenging will be critical to company stability, growth and ultimately longevity.</p>
<p>In Q4 of 2020, ClinLab surveyed Life Science professionals about how they felt about the 2020 and 2021 life science employment landscape in our 2020 Life Science Annual Job Seeker and Employer Survey. We found that 49% of respondents browsed jobs in 2020 with  38% of those surveyed planning to actively seek or browse for new opportunities in 2021.</p>
<p>Did you know that when an employee leaves, companies lose productivity and money at an alarming rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>It typically takes an average 3.5 months to replace non-executive positions</li>
<li>An empty position can cost a company upwards of $500 per day</li>
<li>Stalled projects, regulatory gaps and deadline impacts can be costly</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Life Science/Biotechnology/Pharmaceutical Staffing: </b><b>Pivot and Ramp Up</b></p>
<p>In the cases of rapid ramp-up, companies can also face serious challenges in other areas they may not currently be serving.  In 2020 we saw a slew of companies pivot to the rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19 and with that came an unprecedented increase in life science jobs as companies tried to pad their staff with enough bandwidth to complete their day to day operations as well as serve the current climate.</p>
<p>We saw increases across the board but particularly heavily in titles such as lab tech, quality control, process development, accessioning technicians and clinical research associates. So how do companies handle massive, rapid changes in staffing needs so quickly and effectively? With Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions, of course!</p>
<p><b>Temporary Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions</b></p>
<p>While employers should always focus on expanding their recruitment channels as a way to prepare for staffing changes and employee turnover, most organizations will look to staffing and recruiting companies as the top method for recruiting quality talent. According to Hubspot, when companies were asked to identify their most effective recruiting method, staffing and recruitment companies ranked the highest.</p>
<p>So while the market still looks bullish for job seekers, the prospect of big job turnover looms large as a major challenge for businesses and we can help. A firm like ClinLab Staffing has a robust, vetted stable of <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-sciences-recruitment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">qualified temporary contract lab and life science staff</a>, we make life easier and get a company on mission fast in times of transition.  ClinLab also offers <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-science-staffing-payroll-solutions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">payroll solutions</a> to allow companies to add staff as needed without adding to payroll or overall permanent headcount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regions we serve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boston/Cambridge, MA</li>
<li>New York / New Jersey</li>
<li>Greater Philadelphia</li>
<li>Raleigh-Durham, NC (includes Research Triangle Park, NC)</li>
<li>BioHealth Capital Region [Maryland / Virginia / Washington, D.C.]</li>

With all of the video conferencing software available, virtual interviews, as opposed to meeting face to face, have become essential and much more common than ever before.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3572" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-hiring-staffing-online-biotech.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="virtual hiring of staffing online life science" width="1800" height="1440" srcset="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-hiring-staffing-online-biotech.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1800w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-hiring-staffing-online-biotech-1280x1024.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-hiring-staffing-online-biotech-980x784.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 980w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-hiring-staffing-online-biotech-480x384.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>As the person conducting the interview, here are some tips to make sure you&#8217;re giving your potential hires the best virtual interview experience possible :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plan Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Before the interview takes place, be sure to test your technology, read the candidate’s resume and prepare some questions you’d like to ask, the same things you would do for an in person interview. The more prepared you are, the more confident you come off and for a potential hire, it’s important for them to see that confidence and see your preparedness as it relates to both the interview, the company, and your technological abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be Friendly </strong></p>
<p>Creating a connection virtually can be difficult so be sure to be friendly, explain your role within the company, go over the structure of the virtual interview and make sure the potential hire feels comfortable as you get started. Make sure your questions are solid and be mindful of your tone. Small talk, which can be awkward in general, can feel even more awkward over a video call, so keeping it light but insightful is key and remember, you’re trying to create a connection with the potential hire, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be Present </strong></p>
<p>Similarly to how you want your potential hire to be free from distractions, the same should go for you. Shut off your phone notifications, close out of your email or office chat systems, and turn off any music or TV that may be running in the background. As you’re conducting the interview during your work day, it may be tempting to check your email or make a note on a project that pops into your head, but resist it. Being distracted can ruin the flow of the interview and make the potential hire nervous so be sure to keep your focus on the interview. If you plan on taking notes throughout the conversation, let the potential hire know this at the beginning of the interview so that they know you’re still listening and engaged if you begin to write things down, but don’t use this as an excuse to try and multitask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Set the Stage </strong></p>
<p>Set your computer up, turn on your camera, and take a look at what’s visible behind you. What setting in your space looks most professional and also the least distracting? Conducting an interview in your home is much different than an office setting, but be sure to dress and act the same as if you were meeting face to face. Being conscious of your background is important, as your setting tells the potential hire as much about you as their background does for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be An Active Listener</strong></p>
<p>Multitasking has become a norm in many office environments. With the abundance of multi-person video and conference calls the past few months have seen, it’s easy to get distracted and answer with one syllable. This is not one of those times. While you may conduct multiple video interviews in a day, the potential hire does not, and this interview is very important for them. It’s imperative that you, as the potential hire, are giving them your full attention and truly listening to their answers and the information that they’re sharing with you. Their attention is fully directed towards you, so give them the same respect. Afterall, they may be your newest coworker!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3562" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="how to do virtual interviews job" width="1800" height="1200" srcset="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1800w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-1280x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-980x653.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 980w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-480x320.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Preparing for a virtual interview can be nerve-wracking, so we’ve put together the following tips to help set you up for success.</p>
<p><b>Dress for Success </b></p>
<p>Even if you’re only visible from the waist up, prepare for this interview as if you were going into an office for a face to face meeting. Putting your best professional foot forward is important, even virtually. Making sure you project that professionalism is tough through a screen, so your attire is a good place to start and yes, that includes pants.</p>
<p><b>Test your Tech </b></p>
<p>Technology is key in times like these. Not only are you being interviewed on your skills in relation to the job you’ve applied for, but in a way, you’re also being tested on your technological skills and ability to be proactive and problem solve. Ask for the technology and details for the virtual interview in advance, and then test your set up to make sure everything runs smoothly. Does your camera work? Is your audio clear? How strong is your internet connection? These are all things that can be done before the interview to alleviate stress day of and avoid the embarrassment of a technological problem during the interview.</p>
<p><b>Be Aware of What’s Visible in the Background </b></p>
<p>As tempting as it may be to sit on the couch and be comfortable or show off your gallery wall you’ve worked so hard on, don’t. Set your computer up, turn on your camera, and take a look at what’s visible behind you. What setting in your space looks most professional and also the least distracting? Make sure your space is clean and tidy, messy backgrounds make it hard to convince a potential employer that you’re organized and detail oriented, and also make sure you’re the focal point. Lighting is key, so if possible, pick a space with a lot of natural light.</p>
<p><b>Remove Distractions</b></p>
<p>This one may be tough, but it’s doable. Interviewing from home means there are distractions galore. The TV, ringing phones,  your pets, your roommates or children, construction happening outside, the list goes on and on. Do what you can to eliminate the easiest distractions, and prepare for the possibility that you’re still interrupted. You can’t plan for every potential distraction, but even a little preparation helps. If you have kids or are caring for an elderly family member, feel free to be proactive and let your potential employers know at the start of the interview.</p>
<p><b>Practice</b></p>
<p>The best part of a virtual interview is the ability to do it within the comfort of your own space. This gives you the opportunity to practice in the same environment as the interview. Go over the questions you may have, the answers to questions they may ask, your body language, and anything else you don’t want to forget or feel you’d like to practice. Avoid memorizing answers, you don’t want to sound scripted, but use Post-It Notes to write down reminders and talking points, and stick them to the computer screen or the wall within your line of sight so you don’t have to fidget or look down at a piece of paper during the interview. Adjust the camera angle to make sure you’re looking straight on, not up or down, and that it’s comfortable so that you can sit straight up.</p>
<p><b>Follow Up </b></p>
<p>Just as you treated the process before the virtual interview the same as you would if it were in person, do the same for post interview. This includes following up with the people you interviewed within 24 hours of the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip: When <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-sciences-candidates/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">working with a recruiter</a>, be sure to ask them how best to follow up with a company &#8211; this will save you time and effort up front!</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That said, do send an email thanking them for taking the time to speak with you, and use this as an opportunity to ask a question you thought of after and wish you had asked, or elaborating on a point you felt was important. Keep your message tone professional and messages should short and to the point.</p>
