										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, we award the “Rising Star Award” to a top performer who has really grown and excelled in their position.  This year we saw so much talent that we had to choose more than one! The winners of this award have always been someone that management sees a lot of future potential in and many of the past winners remain top performers today.  Some of the attributes that exemplify what it means to be a “Rising Star” are a Positive Attitude, Leadership Skills, Teamwork, Hard-Work and Dedication.</p>
<p><b>We are proud to present a Rising Star award to Emily McDonald, a scientific recruiter in our Massachusetts Division. </b></p>
<p>Emily joined us in 2019 as an entry level recruiter after graduating from <a href="https://ceps.unh.edu/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of New Hampshire</a> with a degree in Biomedical Science. Shortly after she began her group shifted into a super group under new leadership and Emily&#8217;s work ethic and personality really stood out as exceptional.  As more group changes happened due to the pandemic she showed us how flexible she could be to &#8220;role with the punches&#8221; and to keep making things happen. More impressively she showed us her ability to produce at a high level while balancing both recruiting and client relations, something that often comes later in a recruiter&#8217;s career.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Emily has really boosted up the level of the group, working roles that nobody else was interested in resulting in a ton of new opportunity.&#8221; &#8211; <em>Sean Reilly, account manager, group leader and former Rising Star recipient.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations Emily on your Rising Star Achievement!</p>

<p><b>We are proud to present a Rising Star award to Zach West, an account manger/scientific recruiter in our Mid-Atlantic Division. </b></p>
<p><a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/zachary-west/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach</a> joined ClinLab Staffing in 2018, coming from a background as an entrepreneur in masonry looking to expand into the field of sales. It didn&#8217;t take long for him to become one of the top recruiters. At the start of the pandemic Zach was promoted to an account manager role, focusing on a brand new territory in Maryland. We were all amazed to see his fierce determination at work building new client relationships in the midst of the uncertain pandemic. His proven success in the new territory allowed him to expand his team and we are so proud to continue to watch them grow.</p>
<p>Congratulations Zach on your Rising Star Achievement!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 was an odd year and 2021 shaping up to be much the same for the Biotech and Pharma industries.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebooth/2021/01/04/the-biotech-paradox-of-2020-a-year-in-review/?sh=675ac5b943b3&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Forbes Magazine</a>, 2020 was “the greatest year ever for the biopharma industry” and it was true -it’s still true. Along with the wild ride that was 2020, we’ve seen a light shined on the critical role our human capital has in the success, performance and growth of life science companies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3681" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="rapid employee staff changes science" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1920w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-1280x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-980x653.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 980w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rapid-staffing-changes-life-sciences-lab-biotech-2021-2022-480x320.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1920px, 100vw" />In a year where labs rapidly ramped up to meet the challenges of COVID-19, businesses and municipalities doubled, tripled and even quadrupled their lab techs and data analysts as they scrambled to find new ways to measure and understand the world. Labs were inundated with human testing needs, clinical trials launched at an astronomical rate, massive testing programs struggled to meet public health and consumer needs all while new rapid diagnostic tests were being rolled out across the globe. Our science community was pushed like never before, and they delivered.</p>
<p>Now, in 2021 and 2022, procuring the right talent to meet the ever-changing workforce needs that continue to get more complex and challenging will be critical to company stability, growth and ultimately longevity.</p>
<p>In Q4 of 2020, ClinLab surveyed Life Science professionals about how they felt about the 2020 and 2021 life science employment landscape in our 2020 Life Science Annual Job Seeker and Employer Survey. We found that 49% of respondents browsed jobs in 2020 with  38% of those surveyed planning to actively seek or browse for new opportunities in 2021.</p>
<p>Did you know that when an employee leaves, companies lose productivity and money at an alarming rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>It typically takes an average 3.5 months to replace non-executive positions</li>
<li>An empty position can cost a company upwards of $500 per day</li>
<li>Stalled projects, regulatory gaps and deadline impacts can be costly</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Life Science/Biotechnology/Pharmaceutical Staffing: </b><b>Pivot and Ramp Up</b></p>
<p>In the cases of rapid ramp-up, companies can also face serious challenges in other areas they may not currently be serving.  In 2020 we saw a slew of companies pivot to the rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19 and with that came an unprecedented increase in life science jobs as companies tried to pad their staff with enough bandwidth to complete their day to day operations as well as serve the current climate.</p>
<p>We saw increases across the board but particularly heavily in titles such as lab tech, quality control, process development, accessioning technicians and clinical research associates. So how do companies handle massive, rapid changes in staffing needs so quickly and effectively? With Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions, of course!</p>
<p><b>Temporary Biopharma Life Science Staffing Solutions</b></p>
<p>While employers should always focus on expanding their recruitment channels as a way to prepare for staffing changes and employee turnover, most organizations will look to staffing and recruiting companies as the top method for recruiting quality talent. According to Hubspot, when companies were asked to identify their most effective recruiting method, staffing and recruitment companies ranked the highest.</p>
<p>So while the market still looks bullish for job seekers, the prospect of big job turnover looms large as a major challenge for businesses and we can help. A firm like ClinLab Staffing has a robust, vetted stable of <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-sciences-recruitment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">qualified temporary contract lab and life science staff</a>, we make life easier and get a company on mission fast in times of transition.  ClinLab also offers <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-science-staffing-payroll-solutions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">payroll solutions</a> to allow companies to add staff as needed without adding to payroll or overall permanent headcount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regions we serve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boston/Cambridge, MA</li>
<li>New York / New Jersey</li>
<li>Greater Philadelphia</li>
<li>Raleigh-Durham, NC (includes Research Triangle Park, NC)</li>
<li>BioHealth Capital Region [Maryland / Virginia / Washington, D.C.]</li>

With all of the video conferencing software available virtual interviews, as opposed to meeting face to face have become essential and much more common than ever before.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3562" src="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss" alt="how to do virtual interviews job" width="1800" height="1200" srcset="https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1800w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-1280x853.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 1280w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-980x653.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 980w, https://clinlabstaffing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/remote-job-interview-how-to-480x320.jpg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1800px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Preparing for a virtual interview can be nerve-wracking, so we’ve put together the following tips to help set you up for success.</p>
<p><b>Dress for Success </b></p>
<p>Even if you’re only visible from the waist up, prepare for this interview as if you were going into an office for a face to face meeting. Putting your best professional foot forward is important, even virtually. Making sure you project that professionalism is tough through a screen, so your attire is a good place to start and yes, that includes pants.</p>
<p><b>Test your Tech </b></p>
<p>Technology is key in times like these. Not only are you being interviewed on your skills in relation to the job you’ve applied for, but in a way, you’re also being tested on your technological skills and ability to be proactive and problem solve. Ask for the technology and details for the virtual interview in advance, and then test your set up to make sure everything runs smoothly. Does your camera work? Is your audio clear? How strong is your internet connection? These are all things that can be done before the interview to alleviate stress day of and avoid the embarrassment of a technological problem during the interview.</p>
<p><b>Be Aware of What’s Visible in the Background </b></p>
<p>As tempting as it may be to sit on the couch and be comfortable or show off your gallery wall you’ve worked so hard on, don’t. Set your computer up, turn on your camera, and take a look at what’s visible behind you. What setting in your space looks most professional and also the least distracting? Make sure your space is clean and tidy, messy backgrounds make it hard to convince a potential employer that you’re organized and detail oriented, and also make sure you’re the focal point. Lighting is key, so if possible, pick a space with a lot of natural light.</p>
<p><b>Remove Distractions</b></p>
<p>This one may be tough, but it’s doable. Interviewing from home means there are distractions galore. The TV, ringing phones,  your pets, your roommates or children, construction happening outside, the list goes on and on. Do what you can to eliminate the easiest distractions, and prepare for the possibility that you’re still interrupted. You can’t plan for every potential distraction, but even a little preparation helps. If you have kids or are caring for an elderly family member, feel free to be proactive and let your potential employers know at the start of the interview.</p>
<p><b>Practice</b></p>
<p>The best part of a virtual interview is the ability to do it within the comfort of your own space. This gives you the opportunity to practice in the same environment as the interview. Go over the questions you may have, the answers to questions they may ask, your body language, and anything else you don’t want to forget or feel you’d like to practice. Avoid memorizing answers, you don’t want to sound scripted, but use Post-It Notes to write down reminders and talking points, and stick them to the computer screen or the wall within your line of sight so you don’t have to fidget or look down at a piece of paper during the interview. Adjust the camera angle to make sure you’re looking straight on, not up or down, and that it’s comfortable so that you can sit straight up.</p>
<p><b>Follow Up </b></p>
<p>Just as you treated the process before the virtual interview the same as you would if it were in person, do the same for post interview. This includes following up with the people you interviewed within 24 hours of the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Pro tip: When <a href="https://clinlabstaffing.com/life-sciences-candidates/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">working with a recruiter</a>, be sure to ask them how best to follow up with a company &#8211; this will save you time and effort up front!</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That said, do send an email thanking them for taking the time to speak with you, and use this as an opportunity to ask a question you thought of after and wish you had asked, or elaborating on a point you felt was important. Keep your message tone professional and messages should short and to the point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most of America is locked down at home, in almost every case, pharmaceutical, medical device and equipment, and biotechnology companies (including operations, research and development, manufacture, and supply chain) organizations are considered essential workers and are facing this global challenge head on.</p>
<p>Even with diminished staff and resources, the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry continues to work toward the development of diagnostics, vaccines and therapies for respiratory infection.</p>
<p>The FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration) has taken action to streamline discovery, while many diagnostic tools and drug targets are starting to find their way into the greater conversation about how to handle SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease itself.</p>
<h2>FDA Activity</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-provides-more-regulatory-relief-during-outbreak-continues-help?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">More Regulatory Relief</a>: The FDA will provide regulatory relief during the outbreak.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-update-foreign-inspections?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Foreign Inspections</a>: In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the FDA is postponing most foreign inspections.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#coronavirus2019?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Authorization of Emergency Use</a>: On the basis of this determination, the FDA Secretary declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of personal respiratory protective devices during the COVID-19 outbreak.</li>
</ul>
<p>While regulatory issues are being managed, some companies are starting to make progress on diagnostic tools. Testing has been a significant challenge for the US and is essential for identifying people who have been infected and for understanding the true scope of the outbreak. A few companies are making strides in this space.</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbott: The FDA <a href="https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-03-18-Abbott-Receives-FDA-Emergency-Use-Authorization-and-Launches-Test-to-Detect-Novel-Coronavirus?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">approved</a> <a href="https://www.biospace.com/employer/545692/abbott-laboratories/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Abbott</a>’s molecular test for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The company indicates it is immediately shipping 150,000 Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA tests to current customers in the U.S.</li>
<li>Biomerica has begun shipping samples of this COVID-19 test to multiple Ministries of Health and government agencies that have requested the product through the company’s distributors in the Middle East, throughout Europe, and other countries</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, what will help get the global population back to life as we knew it will be healing and preventive measures. Here, companies are attempting to find therapies to treat the illness and eventually prevent infection.</p>
<h2><b>Failed clinical studies</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>In adults with severe COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan, China, treatment using a combination of antiviral drugs – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopinavir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">lopinavir</a>–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">ritonavir</a> (HIV/AIDS therapies) – provided no benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Vaccine candidates</b></h2>
<p>Two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Phase I safety clinical trials</a> on vaccine candidates were initiated:</p>
<ul>
<li>mRNA-1273: The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) collaborated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Moderna</a> to develop an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">RNA vaccine</a> matching a spike of the coronavirus surface.</li>
<li>Ad5-nCoV: A Phase I safety trial of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_protein?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">recombinant</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenovirus?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">adenovirus</a> vaccine candidate manufactured by CanSino Biologics Inc. (Tianjin, China), called Ad5-nCoV, began recruiting 108 healthy adults in Wuhan, China in March.</li>
<li>Several other vaccine candidates were being fast-tracked to begin first-in-human studies, as of March 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Post-exposure prevention</b></h2>
<p>Based on experience with antimicrobials, pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs may be effective procedures to minimize infection which causes COVID-19.  PEP using the antibiotic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">rifampicin</a>, is recommended by WHO for people at high risk of infection before or after exposure to pandemic influenza. Some experts speculate that antiviral drugs administered shortly after the onset of COVID-19 infection symptoms may reduce illness and lower the risk of infecting other people by reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">viral shedding</a> in respiratory secretions.</p>
<h2><b>Repurposing approved drugs</b></h2>
<p>During the COVID-19 outbreak, drug repurposing (or “repositioning”) is the clinical research process of rapidly screening and defining the safety and efficacy of existing drugs already approved for other diseases to be used for people with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Clinical trials using repurposed, generally safe, existing drugs for hospitalized COVID-19 patients may take less time and have lower overall costs to obtain endpoints proving safety (absence of serious side effects) and post-infection efficacy, and can rapidly access existing drug supply chains for manufacturing and worldwide distribution.</p>
<h2><b>Phase III trials</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Favipiravir: In people with COVID-19, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favipiravir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">favipiravir</a> (marketed as Avigan and approved for use in Japan in 2014 for several viral diseases) was found to be safe and had preliminary efficacy in an early-stage trial in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Shenzhen</a>, China.</li>
<li>Remdesivir: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilead_Sciences?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Gilead Sciences</a> antivirus drug candidate is in multiple clinical trials, with preliminary results expected in May 2020</li>
<li>ASC-09 + ritonavir (oral tablet): ASC-09 (product of the Chinese firm, Ascletis Pharma Inc.), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-1?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">HIV-1</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">protease inhibitor</a> in combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">ritonavir</a>, was initiated in a Phase III trial in China during February 2020 to assess efficacy against COVID-19.</li>
<li>Tocilizumab: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">monoclonal antibody</a> with activity against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin-6_receptor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">interleukin-6 receptor</a> involved in inflammation, tocilizumab is already marketed under the trade name, Actemra, to treat arthritis. It is under clinical development to determine safety and efficacy against pneumonia in hospitalized people with COVID-19. The manufacturer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">Genentech</a>, announced the April start of a Phase III trial across several countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>There is no need to reiterate that these are unprecedented times. Recently released <a href="https://youtu.be/kF_TZjECSLg?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">drone footage video of Boston </a>tells a clear story about how seriously many communities are taking the COVID-19 Stay-At-Home declarations across America. In these times, ClinLab wishes the labs and companies working on the COVID-19 challenge the best of luck and applauds and supports their efforts.</strong></em></p>
